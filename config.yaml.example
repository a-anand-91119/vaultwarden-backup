# Vaultwarden Backup Manager Configuration (YAML)

# IMPORTANT NOTE ON PATHS:
# - When running the script DIRECTLY on the host:
#   Paths like 'data_dir' and 'backup.destination.path' should be the ACTUAL paths on your host machine.
# - When running the script via Docker (using docker-compose.yaml or docker run):
#   Paths like 'data_dir' and 'backup.destination.path' MUST match the TARGET paths
#   specified in the 'volumes' section of your docker command/compose file
#   (e.g., '/data' and '/backup' respectively, based on the examples provided).

vaultwarden:
  # Name or ID of the running Vaultwarden Docker container (required)
  # Example: vaultwarden
  container_name: vaultwarden

  # Full path to the directory mapped as Vaultwarden's data volume
  # - If running script directly on host: Use the HOST path (e.g., /srv/vaultwarden/data)
  # - If running script via Docker: Use the CONTAINER path (e.g., /data)
  # (Required)
  data_dir: /path/to/vaultwarden/data # CHANGE THIS (e.g., /data for Docker, /srv/vw/data for host)

backup:
  # --- Scheduling (Used when running in scheduler mode) ---
  schedule:
    # Interval in minutes between backup runs
    # Example: 60 for hourly, 1440 for daily, 10 for every 10 minutes
    interval_minutes: 1440 # Default to daily

  # --- Backup Destination Settings ---
  destination:
    # Type of backup destination: 'local' is currently supported.
    # Future options: 'ssh', 's3'
    type: local

    # Path to the directory where backup archives will be stored
    # - If running script directly on host: Use the HOST path (e.g., /mnt/backups/vaultwarden)
    # - If running script via Docker: Use the CONTAINER path (e.g., /backup)
    # (Required)
    path: /path/to/your/backup/storage # CHANGE THIS (e.g., /backup for Docker, /mnt/backups for host)

  # --- Encryption Settings ---
  encryption:
    # Enable GPG encryption for backups (true/false)
    enabled: false
    # GPG Recipient Key ID or Email (required if enabled=true)
    # Example: mygpgkey@example.com or ABCDEF01
    gpg_key_id: ""

  # --- Retention Policy ---
  retention:
    # Number of daily backups to keep
    daily: 7
    # Number of weekly backups to keep (runs on Sunday)
    weekly: 4
    # Number of monthly backups to keep (runs on the 1st)
    monthly: 6

  # --- Restore Settings ---
  restore:
    # Temporary directory for downloading/extracting backups during restore
    # - If running script directly on host: Use a HOST path (e.g., /tmp/vw_restore_temp)
    # - If running script via Docker: Use a path INSIDE the container (e.g., /tmp/vw_restore_temp)
    # (Required)
    temp_dir: /tmp/vw_restore_temp

    # --- Permissions ---
    # User and group numeric ID to set ownership on restored data_dir (requires sudo)
    # Match the PUID/PGID environment variables used when running the container.
    # Leave blank or omit to skip explicit chown/chmod (restore might fail if permissions are wrong)
    # Example: owner_uid: 1000
    # Example: owner_gid: 1000
    owner_uid: # e.g., 1000
    owner_gid: # e.g., 1000

notifications:
  # Placeholder for future notification settings (e.g., email, webhook)
  enabled: false
  email_to: ""
  webhook_url: ""
